# I-am-Rich-I-am-Poor

This is your first homework assignment for iOS programming. Be sure to read through the all of the directions. Let me know if you have any questions.

For this assignment, you will be creating your first app. This app will have no true functionality. The app will open and display an image and some text.

-First, download the contents of this repo (ie, coal.png) to your computer.  
-Second, create a single-view application in xcode.  
-Next, do the following:    
  -add a label.  
  -change the labels text to "I am Poor" (no quotes).  
  -add an image.  
  -link image to the coal.png file.  
  -change background color.  
  -change text color.  
  -Make sure the background and text colors have enough contrast to be readable! If the two are too dark or too light, it will     significantly decrease the readability.  
-Lastly, you must COMMIT and PUSH your completed app to our GitHub Classroom's repo (I'll give you a link)
